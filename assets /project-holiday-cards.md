In graduate school I took a lot of printmaking classes as a way to bring illustration back in to my design work. The more I experimented with printmaking, the more I fell in love with the medium which lead me to the purchase of a small press to print my linocuts and woodcuts. Little did I know at the time that the press was actually a Poco proofing press meant to create letterpressed prints.

After some research I purchased supplies and set out on the task of learning how to use this new found treasure. This is how the holiday card series was born. It was a simple attempt for me to learn how to use my Poco proof press and create something to share with others. I'm still refining my skills and learning the limitations of my press and the medium in general, but it's definitely a fun exercise.
